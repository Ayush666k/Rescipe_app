Project Name: Recipes App
Description:
The Recipes App is a mini-project built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. This app allows users to browse, search, and share their favorite recipes. It includes features such as user authentication, recipe creation, editing, and deletion, as well as a user-friendly interface for exploring recipes by category or ingredients.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Recipe Management: Authenticated users can add, edit, or delete their recipes.

Search Functionality: Users can search for recipes by name, ingredients, or category.

Categories and Tags: Recipes can be organized into categories (e.g., Breakfast, Dessert) and tagged with keywords.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Django (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Database: SQLite (default Django database)

Other Tools: Django Allauth for authentication, Django Crispy Forms for form styling

Purpose:
This project was created to practice and demonstrate my skills in Django web development, including database management, user authentication, and frontend-backend integration. It serves as a foundation for building more complex food-related applications in the future.
